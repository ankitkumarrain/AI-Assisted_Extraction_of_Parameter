      description: "The convention for using the upper 4 bits of CSR address (csr[11:8]) to encode read/write accessibility according to privilege level"
      type: enumeration
      constraints:
        - "Uses upper 4 bits of 12-bit CSR address space"
        - "Top two bits (csr[11:10]) indicate read/write (00, 01, or 10) or read-only (11)"
        - "Next two bits (csr[9:8]) encode lowest privilege level that can access the CSR"
        - "Referred to as 'conventional' approach"
        - "Details specified in Table 1 (reference)"
      source_quote: "By convention, the upper 4 bits of the CSR address (csr[11:8]) are used to encode the read and write accessibility"

      discovery_method: "Defined by convention, not mandatory"
      notes: "This is described as a 'convention' rather than a strict requirement, suggesting implementations may deviate. The use of 'by convention' implies this is implementation-defined behavior that follows a standard pattern."

  analysis_notes:
    ambiguity: "The phrase 'by convention' is somewhat ambiguous - it could mean this is a strong recommendation that all implementations follow, or it could indicate this is optional/implementation-defined. The markdown emphasis on 'address mapping' and 'Table 1' in the original text suggests these are significant parameters."
    extraction_rationale: "While 'by convention' is not in the explicit trigger phrase list, it strongly implies implementation flexibility and optional adherence, which aligns with the parameter extraction goal."
    alternative_interpretation: "This could also be interpreted as a mandatory standard that all implementations must follow, in which case it would NOT be a parameter. Additional context from the specification would clarify."
